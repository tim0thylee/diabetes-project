# diabetes-project

Things completed:
1) Age feature now binary (<= 48 is 0 and >48 is 1)
2) Swapped gender so female is 0 and male is 1 (model works better)

Things to work on for Timothy:
1) Analyze for possible feature deletion. May or may not have to.
2) Implement logistic regression to see how performance works.
