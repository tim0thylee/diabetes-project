# diabetes-project

This is the diabetes prediction machine learning project for Timothy Lee and Andres Medina

The following technologies/libraries are required to run the program:
1) Python
2) SKLearn
3) Seaborn
4) Matplotlib
5) Numpy
6) Pandas
7) Jupyter Notebook
8) Scipy

There are two notebooks:
1) Baseline.ipynb: Baseline Models
2) Diabetes.ipynb: Main program and Analysis

For grading purposes, focus on the Diabetes.ipynb. It will contain all the analysis and main models. 
However, the baseline data come from the Baseline notebook. This was to separate concerns for easier
programming and viewing.
