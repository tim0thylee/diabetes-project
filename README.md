# diabetes-project

Things completed:
1) Age feature now binary (<= 48 is 0 and >48 is 1)
2) Swapped gender so female is 0 and male is 1 (model works better)
3) Implemented models for KNN-weighted, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree with analysis. 

Things to work on for Timothy:
1) Attempt to do model by taking out itching to see what the models will look like. Chi test shows it has the lowest rank
2) Implement Baseline model (https://blog.jcharistech.com/2021/05/13/how-to-set-a-baseline-for-machine-learning-models-in-python/)
